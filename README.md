# AI-not-really
A tic tac toe game web app
The general conception of non-programmers about AI beign a completely created self intelligence is not all that true
in this project using the javascript if and else function i was ableto mimic artificial intelligence whereby when ever the user choses a section the AI automatically looks for the best possible response. this functions include  to determine "X" or "O" and if player makes the first move, "AI" or "player" as input, POST: false if win not possible, else id of field to win, boolean if player has placed corner, POST: decides where the AI places the sign, if all corners occupied or no corner selected (rare) select the center amongst various other javascript functions.
